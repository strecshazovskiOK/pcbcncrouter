homing and gotoz scripts are related with mach interface buttons. homing is for all type of CNCs because it uses homing function for axis. If you are using more than 3 axis you will need to add a block of code for that axis as well The working logic of that code is when the axis hit the limited switch, program understands that it is home for that axis.
