3-Axis CNC Control with Arduino Mega 2560

Overview

This project provides the Arduino code to control a 3-axis CNC machine using potentiometers. The code is designed to work with an Arduino Mega 2560, and it interfaces with an M542-05 Leadshine microstep driver for precise stepper motor control. The system allows manual control of the X, Y, and Z axes through three potentiometers.
Features
3-Axis Control: Adjust the X, Y, and Z axes of the CNC machine using separate potentiometers.
Arduino Mega 2560: Utilizes the powerful and versatile Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller for controlling the CNC machine.
Microstep Driver Interface: Compatible with M542-05 Leadshine microstep drivers, enabling smooth and precise control of stepper motors.
Manual Operation: Provides a simple interface for manually controlling the CNC machine without the need for complex software.

Components

Arduino Mega 2560: The main microcontroller board used in this project.
Potentiometers (x3): Used to manually control the movement of the CNC machine on the X, Y, and Z axes.
M542-05 Leadshine Microstep Driver: Used to control the stepper motors connected to each axis.
Stepper Motors: Motors that move the CNC machine's axes.

Wiring Diagram

Hereâ€™s how the components should be connected:
X-axis: Connect the first potentiometer to an analog input pin on the Arduino Mega 2560 and the corresponding stepper motor to the X-axis output on the M542-05 driver.
Y-axis: Connect the second potentiometer to another analog input pin and the corresponding stepper motor to the Y-axis output on the M542-05 driver.
Z-axis: Connect the third potentiometer similarly and connect the stepper motor to the Z-axis output on the M542-05 driver.
Please refer to the code comments for specific pin connections and settings.

Installation
Upload the Code: Open the 3axis3potControlMega.ino file in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your Arduino Mega 2560.

Usage

Power on the CNC Machine: Ensure that the Arduino Mega 2560 and M542-05 drivers are powered.
Adjust the Potentiometers: Rotate the potentiometers to control the movement of the CNC machine on the X, Y, and Z axes.
Observe the Motion: The CNC machine should respond to the potentiometer adjustments, moving in the corresponding directions.
